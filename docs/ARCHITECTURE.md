# Page Prowler - Architecture Review

## Project Overview
Page Prowler is a web crawling application built in Go that finds and extracts links from websites based on specified search terms. It features both a CLI interface and a REST API, with distributed task processing capabilities.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- Go (Primary language)
- Redis (Task queue and caching)
- Docker (Containerization)
- OpenAPI/Swagger (API documentation)

### Key Dependencies
- Colly (Web crawling)
- Asynq (Task queue)
- Cobra (CLI framework)
- Go-Redis (Redis client)

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services
The application is structured around several key components:

#### Web Crawler Service
- Uses Colly framework for web crawling
- Implements depth-limited crawling
- Supports concurrent crawling operations
- Custom term matching algorithm

#### Task Queue System
- Asynq for distributed task processing
- Redis-backed queue storage
- Supports async processing of crawl jobs

#### API Layer
- RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Endpoints for crawl management and status
- Health check endpoints

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Crawling**
   - Configurable crawl depth
   - Search term matching
   - URL filtering
   - Concurrent crawling

2. **Distributed Processing**
   - Redis-backed task queue
   - Scalable worker processes
   - Fault-tolerant job processing

3. **Multiple Interfaces**
   - CLI for direct usage
   - REST API for service integration
   - Worker mode for processing

endLine: 25
```

### 2. Testing
- Mockery for interface mocking
- Unit testing support
- Integration test capabilities

### 3. Build Process
References:
```Dockerfile
startLine: 1
endLine: 21
```

## Configuration Management
The application uses environment variables and configuration files for settings:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_AUTH=yourpassword
```

## Deployment

### Docker Support
- Multi-stage build process
- Alpine-based production image
- Configurable through environment variables

### Scaling Considerations
1. Horizontal scaling of workers
2. Redis cluster support
3. Container orchestration ready

## Recommendations

### Short-term Improvements
1. Enhanced error handling
2. Metrics collection
3. Rate limiting implementation
4. Caching optimization

### Long-term Improvements
1. Monitoring system integration
2. Advanced crawling patterns
3. Machine learning for term matching
4. Multi-language support

## Conclusion
Page Prowler demonstrates a well-structured Go application with good separation of concerns and modern architectural patterns. The combination of CLI and API interfaces, along with distributed task processing, makes it suitable for both standalone use and integration into larger systems.

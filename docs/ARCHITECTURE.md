# Page Prowler - Architecture Overview

## Project Overview
Page Prowler appears to be a web crawling application built with a microservices architecture using Go and JavaScript/TypeScript. The project uses modern development practices and tools including Docker, Kubernetes, and Redis for distributed task processing.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Go (Primary backend language)
- Redis (Task queue and caching)
- MongoDB (Data storage)
- Docker (Containerization)
- Kubernetes (Orchestration)

### Frontend
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Modern frontend tooling (evidenced by linting configurations)

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services
- Web Crawler Service (Go)
- Task Queue Management (Redis)
- Data Storage Layer (MongoDB)

### 2. Infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 3. Development Tools
- Code Quality Tools
  - Qodana for static analysis
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Go linting
- Testing Framework
  - Unit testing support for both Go and JavaScript

## Code Organization

The project follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
project/
├── backend/        # Go services
├── frontend/       # TypeScript/JavaScript frontend
├── k8s/           # Kubernetes configurations
├── docker/        # Docker configurations
└── docs/          # Documentation
```

## Key Features
1. Distributed web crawling
2. Task queue management
3. Data persistence
4. Containerized deployment
5. Automated testing and quality checks

## Security Considerations
- Redis authentication required
- Environment-based configuration
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality enforcement

## Development Practices
1. Code Quality
   - Static analysis with Qodana
   - Type safety with TypeScript
   - Linting for both Go and JavaScript
   - Automated testing

2. DevOps
   - Containerized development environment
   - Kubernetes deployment support
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions

3. Documentation
   - Code documentation requirements
   - API specifications
   - Markdown documentation

## Configuration Management
The application uses environment variables for configuration:
```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_AUTH=yourpassword
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term Improvements
1. Enhance test coverage
2. Address unused exported functions (e.g., `EnqueueCrawlTask`)
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add API documentation

### Long Term Improvements
1. Implement monitoring and observability
2. Add performance metrics collection
3. Enhance scalability patterns
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add caching strategies

## Dependencies Management
- Go modules for backend dependencies
- NPM/Yarn for frontend dependencies
- Docker for container management
- Kubernetes for orchestration

## Deployment Architecture
The application is designed for cloud-native deployment with:
1. Containerized services
2. Kubernetes orchestration
3. Scalable microservices
4. Distributed task processing

## Conclusion
Page Prowler demonstrates a modern, well-structured application with good separation of concerns and cloud-native architecture. The use of strong typing, automated testing, and comprehensive linting suggests a focus on code quality and maintainability.

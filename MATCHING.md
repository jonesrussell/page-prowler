# Web Crawler Matching

## Current Implementation

### Overview
The TermMatcher is responsible for matching search terms against URL content and anchor text. It uses various text processing techniques to improve matching accuracy.

### Matching Algorithm
The matching algorithm uses a combination of techniques:
1. Text preprocessing (removing hyphens, stopwords, stemming)
2. Exact word matching
3. Similarity comparison using Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm

### Key Components
1. TermMatcher struct: Main component that handles the matching process
2. SmithWatermanGotoh: Used for calculating string similarity
3. Text processing functions: For cleaning and normalizing input

### Process Flow
1. Extract content from URL and anchor text
2. Process and combine the extracted content
3. Compare processed content against search terms
4. Return matching terms

### Matching Criteria
- Exact word match
- Similarity score >= 0.9 using Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm

### Limitations
1. Fixed similarity threshold (0.9) may not be optimal for all cases
2. Limited to English language processing
3. May struggle with multi-word terms or phrases

## Planned Improvements

### Goals
1. Improve matching accuracy for multi-word terms
2. Increase flexibility of matching criteria
3. Enhance performance for large-scale crawling

### Proposed Changes
1. Implement n-gram matching for better phrase handling
2. Add configurable similarity thresholds
3. Introduce caching mechanism for processed terms
4. Support multiple languages

### Implementation Plan
1. Refactor `findMatchingTerms` to support n-gram matching
2. Add configuration options for similarity thresholds
3. Implement a caching layer for processed terms and similarity scores
4. Integrate multi-language support libraries

## Future Considerations
1. Machine learning-based matching for improved accuracy
2. Distributed matching system for better scalability
3. Real-time adjustment of matching criteria based on results feedback
